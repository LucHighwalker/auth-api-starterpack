# Proposal
An api that serves magic the gathering cards' value, stats, alternative prints, price trends, special rules, ban status, etc... 

When a card is searched that is not already in the database, it will scan several sites for info on the card, and create an extensive database on the fly. 

The end goal, is to have a flexible framework, that can be configured to create on the fly databases for any number of things, using magic the gathering as a development guide. So for example, you could configure it to look at sport stats, and create player profiles on the fly, based on websites configured to scan through.
